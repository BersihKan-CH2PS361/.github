# Bersih.Kan: A Comprehensive Platform for Efficient Waste Management Solutions

![Mock-Up Application](https://github.com/BersihKan-CH2PS361/.github/blob/4de3cd7a6cb8195e80f2c90390ce270520c48f16/documentation/mockup%20(1).png)

Coming from different hometowns, our team was personally touched by the waste-related challenges we encountered â€“ from landfill closures to city inconveniences, flooding, and polluted rivers. We also witnessed the efforts of waste pickers trying to make a living. These experiences fueled our shared concern and inspired us to create a solution: a waste management app that connects those with expertise in waste management to those in need of disposal, promoting sustainability and addressing these pressing issues.
